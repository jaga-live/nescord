# nescord

Nescord is used to build highly scalable Discord bots. Currently, we provide a REST feature which should be hosted individually as a separate microservice to handle rate limits and reduce errors using Discordeno.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This library is still under development and yet to provide more features.
